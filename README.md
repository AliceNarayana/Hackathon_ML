# Hackathon_ML
The PGDS and BA of University of Texas in Austin launched a Hackathon Project to challenge us, the students to apply ML knowledge. 
Here is what I was able to do. 
I didnt have so much time, so my approach was to do quickly EDA and to prepare the data to the run the models.
After the project, one topic I would do different, is to spend more time preparing the data and use randon sample of the data not all rows. 
Lesson learned!
I finished the project ranked eleven with 89 using Randon Forest model. 
The time ran out but I kept optimizing the model, and my best model was optimizing Random Forest.
